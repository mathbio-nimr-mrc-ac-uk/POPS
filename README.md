# POPS
POPS (Parameter OPtimized Surfaces) program to compute the solvent accessible surface areas (SASA) of biomolecules.

The POPS program is now hosted as Fraternali lab's GitHub repository
[POPScomp](https://github.com/Fraternalilab/POPScomp).

The original and now discontinued POPS server was running at mathbio.ninmr.mrc.ac.uk.
